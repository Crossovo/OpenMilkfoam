# Based on the Jura Milk Frother Hot & Cold 24019
Defects usually come from the electronics. We implement a new one based on the Arduino (8Bit).

## Background
The milk frother has a good hardware base but unstable electronics. Most defects come from this electronics.

I don't want to throw the appliance away just because the control board fail. 

Replacement Parts are not available on the market. 

Hence this project.

## Boards
There are 2 circuit boards in the unit. 

### A control board 
- with the uC 
- the push button input 
- 3 LEDs for the selection made
- power supply and control of the motor for the rotor

### power electronics board
- with relays for the heater 
- 5V power supply for the control board
- sufficient protection elements (temperature monitor, fuse which trips in case of overtemperature) to protect the unit for thermal overloads.

## intern cable
### from the power electronic board 
There are 4 cables from the power electronic board.

- black - 5V DC
- white - GND
- blue - Input to start the heater
- red - Output from transformer as 1V AC to measure the frequency

### from the uC Board
- GND
- Input for the Motor (5V)

## Functions we need
The device should offer the same functionality with the Arduino as a one button system.  BUT - I additionaly want to enter 3 differnt milks varieties. 

The selection takes place via a single button.

### The rationale:
- The selection of the type (cold/warm/hot) should be able to be changed at the touch of a button. 
- The type of milk can then set by pressing the button for the desired programme. 


### Modus
| Modus  | Heater | Motor  | Duration (sec) | Target Temperatur | LED |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Cold milk foam  | off  | on  | 60  | % | 1 |
| Milk warm  | on (?? sec)  | on  | ???  | 50째C | 2 |
| Milk foam hot  | on (?? sec)  | on  | ???  | 60째C | 3 |

With no input, after 2 sec - the device os going to blinking for 

### Milk varieties
| Milk  | LED blinking |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| cow | 1 | 
| almond | 2 |
| out | 3 |

After 5 seconds later or if no further selection has taken place, the programme starts.

There is no direct temperature measurement of the heating or the milk. 
I assume that everything is controlled via timer (the mains frequency is measured at the uC).

## Tasks for the next steps
- how much time need a cold milk (7째C) from the cooler to heat up to different temperatures in the bootle with max laods
- a programm draft sketch in arduino to implement the "core system" for the one button device


### Feature Ideas
- a sensor as input for the liquid temperature in the vessel (sensor must be plugged in externally)
  - warming baby milk (37째C)
  - perfect milk foam (measured not over time)
- Sound for feedback
- ...
